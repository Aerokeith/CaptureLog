The CaptureLog library (consisting of cLog.h and cLog.cpp) implements a C++ class that enables storage and retrieval of 
debugging-related data in one or more capture logs, which are dynamically-allocated text string-based data structures. 
Conditional triggering functions are provided to facilitate bug isolation. Conditional compilation is used to minimize 
the impact on memory resources when the capture logs are not needed.
